# Conda Project

## Overview
This repository was originally created to work through the book "Make Python Talk". It has since expanded to incorporate elements from "Software Development From A to Z", resulting in a diverse collection of programming examples, tools, and references. The project now includes a modern web application built with React and TypeScript.

## Project Structure

### Main Directories:
- `content/`: Contains the bulk of the project's code and assets
- `webapp/`: React-based web application
- `console/`: Console-related tools or utilities
- `editor/`: Editor-related tools or utilities
- `scripts/`: Various utility scripts

### Content Directory Structure:
The `content/` directory contains several key subdirectories:

1. `cref/`: C programming language references and examples
2. `jref/`: Java programming language references and examples
3. `pyref/`: Python programming language references and examples
4. `ffc/`: Contains two main subdirectories:
   - `sr/`: Speech recognition related code and assets
   - `vim/`: Vim editor related code and configurations

## Key Features

1. **Multi-language Support**: The project includes examples and references for C, Java, and Python programming languages.

2. **Speech Recognition**: A significant portion of the project is dedicated to speech recognition and audio processing, located in the `content/ffc/sr/` directory.

3. **Vim Configuration**: Contains Vim editor configurations and related files in the `content/ffc/vim/` directory.

4. **Web Application**: A React-based web app with TypeScript support, built using Vite.

5. **Build Tools**: Uses Maven for Java projects and npm/Vite for the web application.

6. **Database Management**: Includes references to PostgreSQL and Liquibase for database management.

## Web Application

The `webapp/` directory contains a modern web application with the following features:

- Built with React and TypeScript
- Uses Vite as the build tool and development server
- Includes routing with react-router-dom
- Components for various features like Calendar, Dashboard, Horoscope, LotteryNumber, TodoList, and Weather

### Web App Structure:
- `src/`: Source files for the React application
  - `components/`: React components
  - `routes/`: Routing configuration
- `public/`: Public assets
- `dist/`: Built files for production

### Running the Web App:
To run the web application:

1. Navigate to the `webapp/` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Build for production: `npm run build`
